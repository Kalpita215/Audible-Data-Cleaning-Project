# Audible-Data-Cleaning-Project
Successfully led a data cleaning project for Audible using Power Query, ensuring data consistency, accuracy, and readiness for analysis. The project involved identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, standardizing formats, and transforming raw data into a structured dataset. This experience strengthened my skills in data preprocessing, problem-solving, and leveraging automation tools for data refinement.
